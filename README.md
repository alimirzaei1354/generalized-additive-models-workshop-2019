# Generalized Additive Models Workshop 2019

Notebook and data for a workshop demonstrating generalized additive models.  For more details see the main document: https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/

For those in the workshop, after downloading this [repo](https://github.com/m-clark/generalized-additive-models-workshop-2019/archive/master.zip) and unzipping the files to an appropriate location on your own machine, open the RStudio project inside and, once your project is open, open each of the notebook files in the notebooks folder.  They contain condensed code and exercises related to the main document linked above.

The order of the notebooks.  Note that code in subsequent files assumes that previous files have had all the code run and those objects are in the current R environment.  In other words, only the first file should be considered standalone.
